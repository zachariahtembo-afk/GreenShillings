# Green Shillings — Vision & Systems Overview

## Concept Summary

Green Shillings verifies carbon sequestration across Tanzania and Zambia using satellite imagery, AI MRV pipelines, and open biomass/soil models. Each verified tonne of CO₂ captured mints a $GTS token on a low-cost, energy-efficient blockchain. Proceeds flow automatically into farmers' mobile wallets (M-Pesa, Airtel, etc.), while a reputation layer tracks long-term performance.

## How It Works

1. **Monitoring** – ingest Sentinel-2/Planet imagery, run vegetation and soil-carbon proxies via AI.
2. **Verification** – bundle MRV outputs into tamper-proof records.
3. **Tokenization** – mint $GTS (ERC-20) on Celo/Polygon/Casper once tonnes are confirmed.
4. **Settlement** – disburse funds via smart contracts to farmer wallets (mobile money APIs).
5. **Reputation** – maintain trust scores per farmer/cooperative for future finance access.

## MVP Objectives

- Backend API for MRV ingestion + credit issuance
- Satellite data integration layer
- Blockchain bridge for $GTS minting
- Farmer onboarding portal (web + SMS)
- Dashboard for verifiers and institutional buyers
- Relational schema for parcels, credits, payouts, and reputation

## Future Vision

Position Green Shillings as Africa’s green finance operating system—combining environmental data, AI, and blockchain to make regenerative farming measurable, bankable, and rewarding.
